Few can pay off the loan on time, so they take out additional loans, paying $45 each time, all for the same $255 -- the equivalent of a 460 percent annual rate.

"It's little wonder that L.A. voters and ratepayers, most of whom can only dream of getting the gold-plated retirement packages and high salaries that are awarded to DWP workers, resent the City Council's frequent votes to raise utility rates. They were hit again Wednesday when the council approved a 2.9% hike for water rates, and even steeper annual increases are planned for the next three years. Yet for all the justified populist outrage, there's still a genuine need to raise DWP rates. DWP salaries are built into the utility's operating expenses, but the current rate hikes are needed to pay rising capital costs connected with higher prices for water and electricity, meeting federal and state standards for drinking water and switching to renewable power. Failure to approve the rate increases could result in fines costing ratepayers more than the increases."

"The owners and players can agree to delve into the science of HGH testing, but can’t find a way to get a fair or foul call right by using instant replay? Why is everyone so afraid of technology?

"Because Taylor Swift dresses in purple pastels and perpetually wears a astonished smile, her punch takes listeners by surprise. Swift is, as she told a Madison Square Garden audience she drove to the verge of pandemonium Monday night, a hopeless romantic. She’s also awfully combative. Her love stories have bad guys and girls, and triumph over these adversaries is a large part of what she’s selling so successfully. This is a young woman who’s taken Shakespeare’s ""Romeo and Juliet"" firmly in her tongs and banged the ending into a shape that better fits her all-American optimism (and her desire for victory). She rides off with the prince, the diamond ring and the moral high ground that comes from sticking to your guns when those around you demand compromise.

Analysis of our evaluation data shows that these pit bulls exhibited significantly less aggression toward people than other dogs."

I sell professional services for one of the largest IT consulting firms in the world. When I speak to people outside Minnesota, they think of three things: The Mall of America, cold weather and the Vikings. Without the Vikings, we are just a cold state with a big mall. Never mind that Minnesota is home to more Fortune 500 companies per capita than any other state."
"The Muslim Public Affairs Council, a Los Angeles-based advocacy group, blames bigotry on ""a small cottage industry"" that foments prejudice on the Web and elsewhere.

General fund spending by the state government has bumped up and down a bit in recent years, but it was $102 billion in 2007-08, and is projected at $85.9 billion in the current fiscal year. So taxes may or may not end up being part of the solution, but they won’t be in lieu of cuts."

They’ve made it to the summit with gloom, pessimism (""Every shiny toy that once brought you joy/Will soon begin to cloy and annoy"" is a typical lyric from the new set) and a modest, self-effacing sound. Where other rock guitarists strum power chords, Cake’s Xan McCurdy — one of the true six-string originals working in contemporary pop — picks out scratchy lines and tiny, funky, broken chords.

"øA: You have to have a much longer-term viewpoint. First, you have to change your guidepost. Ask yourself, how much money do I need when I retire? You have to have a strong belief, if you're in good health, that you will live to probably your mid-80s. And if you're a couple who are in your 60s and in good health, statistically, one of the two of you will live to 92. So you need adequacy in your nest egg when you retire to meet those financial needs as you live longer. People today are preoccupied in trying to live a better, longer life. They may be exercising more, taking vitamins, having regular examinations. We do that because we want to live longer. We're so preoccupied with finding a lifestyle that allows us to live longer and more successfully, but we don't take that same horizon when we invest for our retirement. What I'm trying to suggest is once you start to say, I need X dollars in retirement, then you work backwards. You're not going to earn that with zero interest in cash. You're going to need some form of returns, and there are areas where you can earn 4%, 5%, 6% type of returns over a course of a long time, and that's generally shares of dividend-paying companies and other forms of credit such as high-yield and other products that will give you a higher return than cash. So if you needed, let's say, $40,000 pretax to live by or $55,000 pretax to live by, work backwards. Depending on your life, your age, how much money do you need to put away? What type of return do you need to earn to build that nest egg? And I think too few people are focusing on that."

And since then, their attorneys have requested and been granted six postponements of the trial for assorted reasons — the absence of one of the brothers' lawyers, illness, or the desire for more time to investigate. This week, they asked for a delay until the passions stirred by the fatal shooting of Florida teen Trayvon Martin by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman cool, and a change of venue to a location where the Martin case would be less likely to influence jurors.

Kissinger describes Deng's ""acerbic, no-nonsense style, his occasional sarcastic interjections and his disdain of the philosophical in favor of the eminently practical … Deng rarely wasted time on pleasantries, nor did he feel it necessary to soften his remarks by swaddling them in parables"" as Mao did. Eventually, Kissinger says, he developed ""enormous regard for this doughty little man with the melancholy eyes.""

"Every time things get horrifying, though, we cut back to the tech wizards who are orchestrating the whole experience. The “scares” are therefore “ironic” and, being safely cordoned off behind these “quotation marks,” aren’t scary. While some of the one-liners are funny, the only reason I could think of to keep watching is to learn what the overarching reason behind the setup might be. When this answer is delivered, though, it’s weak, and it is given in the clunkiest possible way: A new character simply walks onscreen and explains the back story. Worse: It’s a celebrity cameo. Worse still: The “reveal” nullifies everything the protagonists have been trying to do."

"øDrawing from actual events in Van Gogh's life, Laurence Anholt's book weaves a story about how a little boy named Camille befriends the artist. Camille and his family appeared in paintings created by Van Gogh. This interactive story reveals how, although Van Gogh painted vibrant paintings of the village people and its surroundings, the townspeople of Camille's village thought the painter was odd and ostracized him. But Camille and his family accepted Van Gogh and saw the genius of his work. The book contains 19 puzzles which kids play to bring the characters within the book to life. By tapping illustrations of characters, kids can activate a mode that lets them see the gears and mechanisms that would make the character move. By tapping again on the character, the mechanisms spring apart so that kids can connect them once again. When they do, the character will now appear to animate in the story. Kids can also use simple art tools to repaint the characters so that they appear on the pages how they would like them to look. With soothing background music and the ability to be transported to a museum for closer inspection of Van Gogh's work, this is a great way for kids to learn about this artist and 10 of his famous paintings."

They will be more likely to spend time in prison, will be sicker and will die sooner than those with diplomas.

That's why it was so important for the Maryland General Assembly to pass legislation this year that will gradually increase the state's dropout age to 18. We cannot force students to take their studies seriously or complete their graduation requirements, but we can eliminate any vestiges of cultural norms that implied that dropping out was an acceptable decision."

"HEADLINE in the Brand Expaper, referring to the warm and sunny S.F. weather: ""Summer Takes One Last Shot."" Written by an auslander, obviously. Summer here is cold and foggy. What was happening last wk. was typical S.F. November weather ... Brand Ex and the better newspapers blamed the low voter turnout last wk. on ""a lack of big issues."" What a laugh. There are dozens of big, even HUGE, issues, ranging from Reykjavik (what happened?) to Nicaragua (wotinell are we doing?) to our trillion-dollar debt, but the Democrats are afraid to take them on for fear of being called ""liberal."" We are being nibbled to death by nonentities ... I can't figure out why Rambo Reagan never won an Oscar. What an actor!

He's young, and he wanted to be closer to home. I will always wonder, however, what might have been for Seastrunk at Oregon. Because I believe the guy arrived on campus with major college football talent and was in an offense that would have eventually showcased it."

"All job applications will ask something about the applicant's possible experience with the military. Military experience should not be considered irrelevant, even if that experience may have been 15 or 20 years ago. Presidential Executive Order 11701 requires companies having federal government contracts to give preference to hiring veterans. They audit companies to make sure they give this preference. Thus, provide full information even if you think it is insignificant. Common application information for veterans includes: branch of service, discharge date, discharge type, training received, rank upon discharge and duties."

"The renaissance of Shaker Square as a food destination seems to be in full swing. Chef Sergio Abramof's Sarava anchors the culinary delights to be found on the northeast quadrant. Inspired by the flavors of the chef's native Brazil, Sarava's cuisine fills a rare niche on the local dining scene. Traditional dishes such as feijoada (a rich black-bean stew with sausage and pork) and xim xim(a slow-braised stew of chicken, shrimp, coconut milk and peppers) are as authentically exotic to our palates as they are satisfyingly homey. The ""street plates"" are where the menu really shines. It's easy to fill a table, tapas-style, with dishes such as tamale cakes, artichoke fritters, chicken passarinho (pan-seared chicken morsels in a garlic-scallion sauce). The substantial and spicy stewed calamari plate is practically a meal in itself. Sarava also delivers a sexy and foreign-seeming atmosphere, especially in the dimly lit, high-ceilinged bar area. South American beats provide the perfect soundtrack for sipping a caipirinha cocktail and nibbling the night away."

"ANSWER: Wisdom teeth (third molars) were necessary eons ago when humans had a coarser diet and larger jaws. With evolution, our jaws have gotten relatively smaller and, in many cases, there isn't enough room for them to erupt fully or into a favorable position. Often, these teeth will only partially erupt, leaving a flap of tissue over a portion of the crown of the tooth. Food and bacteria get under this flap and cause an infection. Even if the teeth fully erupt, they are so far back in the mouth that it is difficult to keep them and the surrounding gums clean and healthy."

The last time a baseball team from the nation's capital reached the postseason was 1933, when FDR was in office. It might be time for President Barack Obama to begin warming up his left arm. The call: The Nats just miss the playoffs."
"A Jungian psychologist encouraged Fellini to record his ""night work,"" his dreams, and he did so assiduously from 1960 to '68 and again from 1973 to 1990. It was fertile ground. As a child, Fellini could not wait for bedtime, when he would close his eyes and see absorbing spectacles. He had named the four corners of his bed after four cinemas of Rimini, his birthplace on the Adriatic coast. True to his childhood self, he later was to regard his films as dreams on celluloid. His sketchbooks were partly a record of possible film ideas. One sketch has the worried annotation, ""Have I just let a film idea escape while engaged in my usual neurotic masturbatory fantasies?"""

They note that only 25 of the world's 193 nations have federal systems, and in most of the 25 the freedom of the lower tiers of government is more circumscribed by the central government than American state governments are by the federal government. American states' greater freedom - autonomy under America's system of dual sovereignty - from the central government's supervision requires that they be disciplined instead by the market for government bonds, and the real possibility of default."

Where was he a week ago when it was clear that the two chambers were on a collision course? He needed to be publicly and aggressively involved in pushing the debate from the start, but instead, he took a laissez-faire attitude toward the legislature's handling of the budget. Tweeting ""Hopeful that the GA will pass a compromise that protects priorities like education while creating jobs & expanding opportunity"" two hours and 13 minutes before the legislature is set to adjourn doesn't cut it."

"Top Picks Analysis: A.J. Smith normally isn't gun-shy about moving up in the first round and snaring a player he covets, but the embattled general manager benefited from holding his ground this year. In desperate need of a dangerous pass rusher to give the defense more bite, the Chargers had the good fortune of having one of this year's best in Ingram fall to them at the 18th overall choice. The squatty college lineman can quickly get to the edge with an explosive first step, plus he's stout enough to hold up against the run and displayed excellent lateral agility at the combine that will aid him in coverage. Another possible starter at a thin position was plucked with the second-round selection of Reyes, a powerful and hard-working prospect with the frame to work as a five-technique end in San Diego's 3-4 alignment. Smith's only trade of the draft came in the third round, when he vaulted five spots to claim Taylor, one of the steadying forces on a dominant LSU defense. He's a good tackler with some range and adequate speed, but his best asset may be in the leadership category."

And a new online site, TheBiddingTraveler (www.thebiddingtraveler.com) has mounted a beta version of an automated system to help you bid. As with Priceline's own entry page, you list destination, date(s), and hotel rating; the site also asks you for a minimum-to-maximum bidding rate range. When you select a district within a big city, the site displays recent winning and losing bids at specific hotels within each range. The site responds with a ""recommended lowball offer"" and ""recommended final offer"" rates, based on recent experience. Then, you can either bid manually or the site will automatically bid for you. Other sites that provide information from other travelers about successful bids, unsuccessful bids, and hotel identities include Better Bidding (www.betterbidding.com) and BiddingForTravel (www.biddingfortravel.com). They're always worth a look before you enter an opaque bid or accept an opaque price."
